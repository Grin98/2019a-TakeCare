This is a project for the course "236503 - Project in Software - Android Applications" of the Technion.
TakeCare is a social Android app written in Java and developed on Android Studio, suitable for all audiences over the age of 13.

In the app, you choose the role of either a giver or a taker at any given time.
A giver shares a thing that they own but are not interested in, whereas a taker can browse such things and choose one to schedule a pickup. Start a chat with others to schedule pick-ups and recieve notifications for various events, such as when someone makes a request for one of your listings or when a wish-listed item is posted!
Among the things you can share with others (or express your interest in):
* Food
* Furniture
* Study material
* Hitchhikes
* Lost & Founds
* Just about anything you see fit!

Join the sharing revolution: help brighten someone's day and also help the world by not excessively throwing away like in most modern families! [Find us in Google Play store!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.syv.takecare.takecare)
