# TakeCare

Android app for Technion students to encourage sharing and to fight the phenomena 
of throwing away stuff that might be useful for someone else. In the app, you choose the role of 
a taker or a giver in order to share food, course materials, furniture and for hitchhikings.
You can share with ease, or get notified when there are interesting items nearby that you might want to take a look at.
