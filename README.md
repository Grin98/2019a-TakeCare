# TakeCare

This is a project for the course "236503 - Project in Software - Android Applications" of the Technion.
TakeCare is a social Android app written in Java and developed on Android Studio, suitable for all audiences over the age of 13.

In the app, you choose the role of either a giver or a taker at any given time.
A giver shares a thing that they own but are not interested in, whereas a taker can browse such things and choose one to schedule a pickup.
Among the things you can share with others (or express your interest in):
* Food
* Furniture
* Study material
* Hitchhikes
* Lost & Founds
* Just about anything you see fit!

Join the sharing revolution: help brighten someone's day, and also help the world by not excessively throwing away like in most modern families!
